# 🌊 Water Segmentation Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on segmenting water bodies (e.g., lakes, rivers, oceans) from images using deep learning. A segmentation model was trained on a custom water dataset using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com), enabling pixel-level detection of water regions for applications in environmental monitoring and satellite image analysis.
